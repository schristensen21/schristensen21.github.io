\- Summer in CS98


But NOOOOWWWW, it's hosted at summerchristensen.me instead of schristensen21.github.io (gross). How exciting!
I was already using my personal GitHub account's one GitHub Pages site to host a hack-a-thing from CS98 for a sustainability initiative, so I moved it over to my own domain. Don't worry; I have no attachment or need for this site, so I don't care if I kill it for my landing page.
